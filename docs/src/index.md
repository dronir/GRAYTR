# GRAYTR documentation


GRAYTR (pronounced "greater") is a general-purpose ray-tracer for simulating interaction
between light and space objects. It's main design goals were to simulate

* Solar radiation pressure on space debris
* Space debris photometry and spectrometry
* Laser ranging observations of targets without retro-reflectors

Documentation for GRAYTR is currently almost non-existent, as it's so far under rapid
development and written for my personal use. Currently setting up computations is also
somewhat tedious.

GRAYTR is written in the Julia language.
